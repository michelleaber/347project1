        <ol>
            <li>You will create a website for a client of your choosing. Your client could be a family member, a business, a student group, a friend, an online community, and so on. The only restriction is that the client cannot be just you.
                <ul>
                    <li class="answer">My brother is my client.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Your content must be original and not lifted from other websites. Third-party images are acceptable provided you adhere to their license.
                <ul>
                    <li class="answer">My content is original as i did not lift it from other websites. My images are from webistes that allow you to use one image from them as long as you follow their policies, which i did.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Your site must contain at least five separate pages, each having a meaningful purpose. One of the files should be named index.html, which Apache loads by default.
                <ul>
                    <li class="answer">My site has 6 separate pages; Home, Explore, View Saved Recipes, Create your own recipe and Save a recipe from a website.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Your site must include some sort of header.
                <ul>
                    <li class="answer">My site includes a header which consists of an h1 header (the title of my website) and a navbar.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Your site must include some sort of navigation links.
                <ul>

                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Your site must support distinct layouts for large and small screens using media queries. For instance, multicolumn layouts on large screens should be reduced to single column layouts on small screens.
                <ul>
                    <li class="answer">I use media queries for max-width of 600px, which changes the layout of the header to fit a responsive layout. I have a menu button that when clicked will display the navigation links. </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Your site must maintain a coherent style across its pages. Repeated style rules must be placed in a shared stylesheet. Style rules not shared between pages must be placed in separate stylesheets.
                <ul>

            <li>Your site must include images, and their alt attributes must adequately describe the image content to users of screen readers, user with images disabled, and webcrawlers.
                <ul>
                    <li class="answer">.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Each page must declare its favicon.
                <ul>
                    <li class="answer">Every page on my website has a favicon (a donut with pink icing and sprinkles).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Your site’s non-HTML resources must be organized. Images must be placed in a directory named images. CSS files must be placed in a directory named css. JavaScript must be placed in a directory named js.

            <li>Your site must not be built using any libraries or frameworks. Do not use Bootstrap, jQuery, React, Angular, Vue, or any other third-party tools. You may, however, reimplement the ideas you see in these third-party tools.

                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>The content should be neatly aligned. The axes of alignment should be clearly visible. Favor left- and right-alignment over centering—as centering does not produce a strong axis of alignment.
                <ul>
                    <li class="answer">.</li>
